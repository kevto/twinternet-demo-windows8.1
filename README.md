# Twinternet Demo Windows App

A universal Windows 8.1 app for both Windows Phone 8.1 and Windows 8.1. It's a simple Visual Studio solution using a light version of the hub solution template. The solution includes some of my own written APIs to fetch data from restful services. One of those services is a Wordpress plugin that outputs JSON with information the API asks. Mainly posts, comments and user information.
